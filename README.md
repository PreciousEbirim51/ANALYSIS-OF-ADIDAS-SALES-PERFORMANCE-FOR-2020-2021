This sales analysis aims to evaluate Adidas’ performance across key markets, product categories, and sales channels. By examining revenue trends, regional contributions, and product demand, we can identify strengths, opportunities, and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, this analysis will explore the impact of marketing strategies, seasonal fluctuations, and e-commerce growth on overall sales.

PRE ANALYSIS

A pre-analysis phase was conducted to establish an analytical framework before the creation of the dashboard. This pre-analysis phase involves:

1.	Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
   
2.	Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing during the analysis.

3.	Potential Insights: I was able to uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.

4.	Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1.    In the southeast region, i recommend running new marketing campaigns to get new customers to the outlets.

2.    Due to the low revenue generation in the stores of the south region i recommend promoting some staff from the west region to come and manage some of the stores in the south region to drive revenue generation.

3.    The northeast region needs a digital marketer who can revamp the lead generation system to increase online traffic which can be converted to revenue.

4.    Amazon performance is average, therefore i recommend a change of unit head in this arm of the business to change things and bring new ideas that can increase the sales performance.

5.    Kohl's performance is average, i recommend bringing in new staff in this unit so as to inject new ideas into the unit.

6.    West gear outlet sales and online sales performance is very low compared to the in-store sales therefore there is need to change the team in charge of these units so as to align the performance with the in-store sales performance.

7.    Expand in High-Growth Markets – Increase investment in emerging economies with rising sportswear demand.

8.    Enhance Digital & Direct-to-Consumer Channels – Strengthen online platforms, AI-driven personalization, and seamless omnichannel experiences.

9.    Innovation & Sustainability Focus – Leverage consumer interest in eco-friendly products and performance-driven designs.

10. Dynamic Pricing & Promotions – Implement data-driven pricing strategies to maximize margins while staying competitive

CONCLUSION

The sales analysis of Adidas reveals key insights into the brand’s performance, highlighting both strengths and areas for strategic improvement. Adidas continues to maintain a strong global presence, driven by
